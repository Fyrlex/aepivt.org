                Alpha Epsilon Pi at Virginia Tech is a social fraternity based upon Jewish principles. The brothers of
                AEPi embody both the values of our fraternity: Faith, Humility, Perseverance, Mutual Helpfulness, and
                Honesty, and the values Virginia tech, along with Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).
              </p>
              <p>
                We are active within many student organizations, and are a key part of the Jewish Community of
                Blacksburg. Beyond that, our brothers maintain a high standard of academic success and professional
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our fraternity is not a religious organization, rather a social one that places emphasis on shared
                identities, values, and culture.{' '}

                <p>
                  The mission of Alpha Epsilon Pi is to provide education, resources and training to the future leaders
                  of the worldâ€™s Jewish communities. Alpha Epsilon Pi was founded to provide opportunities for Jewish
                  men seeking the best possible college and fraternity experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since our founding in 1913, more than 102,000 men have worn the badge of Alpha Epsilon Pi and each
                  year, thousands of undergraduates perform the Ritual of Initiation, which remains the same ritual
                  adopted decades ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our basic purpose is to provide the opportunity for a Jewish man to be able to join an organization
                  whose purpose is not specifically religious, but rather social and cultural in nature.{' '}

                The Sigma Alpha Chapter was originally chartered at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
                University in 1969. Sigma Alpha was chosen as the Chapter designation as a homage to the Sigma Alpha Mu
                (Sammy) Fraternity which the founders originally intended to form a chapter of. This iteration of the
                Sigma Alpha chapter lasted at Virginia Tech until the early 80s when they were subsequently dissolved.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the 1999-2000 academic year, 11 eager Jewish students started the recolonization of the Sigma
                Alpha chapter, which has thrived until present day. After being inducted they recruited the first 5
                pledges of Sigma Alpha. These 16 founding fathers laid the groundwork for what would become a tight-knit
                brotherhood committed to Jewish values, philanthropic work, and the betterment of the campus community.
